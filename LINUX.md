# Playing Waddle Forever in Linux

This is a tutorial which assumes you have already installed the game, if you haven't done it, do so in https://waddleforever.com/.

# Requirements

The game uses an AppImage, so you need to install FUSE in order to run it. [Here's one tutorial for installing it](https://github.com/appimage/appimagekit/wiki/fuse).

# Running the game

To run the game, you must first open the folder you installed and then open the terminal, and run:

```sudo ./WaddleForeverServer```

After that is running, then you can go ahead and run the game with this command:

```sudo ./WaddleForeverClient.AppImage --no-sandbox```

A message will pop up. Click to run it serverless.
