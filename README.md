# CPSC 2

CPSC 2 (Name subject to change) is a localhost server emulator and client for playing the game. It is meant to be a straightforward way to setup the game singleplayer, without needing to worry about the underlying networking.

# Server

Besides the client, you can also use the server standalone.

> [!CAUTION]
> The server made for this client is not safe for multiplayer! It can be exploited easily so only host it to people you trust.
> If you wish to make a CPPS, use a different emulator like Houdini

# Credits

The electron client is originally forked from the [Club Penguin Avalanche client](https://github.com/Club-Penguin-Avalanche/CPA-Client).

The server is based in solero's works in reverse engineering the server [(Houdini server emulator)](https://github.com/solero/houdini).

Special thanks to charlotte, who made the original CPSC.
