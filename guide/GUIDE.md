2. Extract the folder

3. Open inside `Waddle Client.exe`. You will likely be warned by computer/antivirus, but you can accept everything as there is no risk in using this program.

4. Enjoy!

> [!WARNING]
> You can only have one client open at a time

# How to play in Browser or Flash Projector

Instead of using the built-in client, you can play in browser or flash projector if that is better for you.

1. In the Waddle Client folder, there is a file called `server.exe`. Open it and a command prompt will show up. This means the game is running.

2. For browser, go to `http://localhost/` to play. For Flash Projector, go to `http://localhost/boots.swf`.

# All Mission speedrun shortcuts

Two commands you should use for speedruns:

!epf - Teleports to the VR Room, where you can play the game (Currently, you can't become an EPF agent normally)

!awards - Gives you half the awards, so you can play it optimally

# Settings

After you play the game once, a file called `settings.toml` will appear. You can open the file and change the settings. Currently, two settings are available:

- `30fps`, set to `true` if you want to play in 30 FPS.
- `thin_ice_igt`, set to `true` to use the Thin Ice IGT mod.

You will need to restart the client or server everytime you make a settings change.

# Data

You can change your database in the folder `data`.
