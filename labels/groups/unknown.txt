- Icon that shows up in the Halloween Party 2010 for the Scavenger Hunt
- Origin is unknown
- I thought it was from a different party, but 2011 and 2007 which have the icon archive don't match
- Then, I thought maybe it was the one in Ben's Scavenger Hunt mod, but that also doesn't match
- So, we don't know its origins!

- The Night of the living Sled 3 movie, unknown where this is from
- This file was given by Resol, but he has no clue where it was fetched from
- and the data does not match the 2009 one in the archives
